\title{Calculate the similarity weight for a set of observations}
\usage{
similarityweight(x, data, threshold = NULL, distance = NULL,
  lambda = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A dataframe describing arbitrary points in the space of the data
(i.e., with same \code{colnames} as \code{data}).}

\item{data}{A dataframe with same names as \code{xc.cond} representing
observed data points.}

\item{threshold}{Threshold distance outside which observations will
be assigned similarity weight zero. This is numeric and should be > 0.}

\item{distance}{The type of distance measure to be used, currently just two
types of Minkowski distance: \code{"euclidean"} (default), and
\code{"maxnorm"}.}

\item{lambda}{A constant to multiply by the number of categorical
mismatches, before adding to the Minkowski distance, to give a general
dissimilarity measure.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector or matrix, with values from 0 to 1. The similarity
  weights for the observations in \code{data} arranged in rows for each row
  in \code{x}.
}
\description{
Calculate the similarity weight for a set of observations, based
on their distance from some arbitary points in data space. Observations which
are very similar to the point under consideration are given weight 1, while
observations which are dissimilar to the point are given weight zero.
}
\details{
Similarity weight is assigned to observations based on their
  distance from a given point. The distance is calculated as Minkowski
  distance between the numeric elements for the observations whose
  categorical elements match, with the option to use a more general
  dissimilarity measure comprising Minkowski distance and a mismatch count.
}
\examples{
## Say we want to find observations similar to the first observation.
## The first observation is identical to itself, so it gets weight 1. The
## second observation is similar, so it gets some weight. The rest are more
## different, and so get zero weight.

data(mtcars)
similarityweight(x = mtcars[1, ], data = mtcars)

## By increasing the threshold, we can find observations which are more
## approximately similar to the first row. Note that the second observation
## now has weight 1, so we lose some ability to discern how similar
## observations are by increasing the threshold.

similarityweight(x = mtcars[1, ], data = mtcars, threshold = 5)

## Can provide a number of points to 'x'. Here we see that the Mazda RX4 Wag
## is more similar to the Merc 280 than the Mazda RX4 is.

similarityweight(mtcars[1:2, ], mtcars, threshold = 3)
