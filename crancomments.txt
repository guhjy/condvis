New submission

## This is the first submission of this package to CRAN, and indeed my first 
## one ever!

* checking R code for possible problems ... NOTE
Found an obsolete/platform-specific call in the following function:
  'opendev'
Found the platform-specific devices:
  'windows' 'x11'
dev.new() is the preferred way to open a new device, in the unlikely
event one is needed.
opendev: possible error in x11(type = "Xlib", width = width, height =
  height): unused argument (type = "Xlib")
  
## The platform-specific calls are necessary, creating interactive graphics.
## The possible error in x11 is due to the platform-specific definition of x11 
## having different arguments on Windows. x11 can only be called on Unix systems
## in this package, so this will not matter.
