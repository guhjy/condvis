=========================================================

Interactively exploring fitted model structures
-----------------------------------------------

Interactively take 2-D and 3-D sections in data space, showing where fitted
models intersect the section, and observed data near the section according to
a distance measure.

Works on Windows, Mac OS and Linux.

Requirements:

  * Mac OS: Xquartz device, [website](http://www.xquartz.org/)
